🎼 Music Mechanics: The Master Blueprint (v21.0)

"Where Physio Minds Connect with Music Minds"

🚀 Project Overview

Music Mechanics is a revolutionary ecosystem blending Neurologic Music Therapy, Professional Audio Production, and Specialized Education. Founded by Jeorge Sourav Roy, it stands at the unique intersection of medical science (BPT, NMTAP) and musical artistry (Berklee, Apple Pro).

This repository contains the interactive Digital Blueprint, a dashboard that visualizes the operational wings, strategic roadmap, and financial ecosystem of the project.

🪐 The Three Planets of Authority

Motion Mechanics (Clinical Wing): Neurologic Rehabilitation (Stroke, SCI, Autism) using Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS).

Music Mechanics (Commercial Wing): A professional-grade rehearsal studio ("Jam Mechanics") and creative production hub.

NMM Institute BD (Education Wing): Certification courses for therapists and musicians.

✨ Features

Interactive Version Control: Toggle between Mixed (English/Bangla), English (Formal), and Bangla (Local) views.

Gemini AI Integration:

🧠 AI Neuro-Architect: Generates NMT clinical prescriptions based on symptoms.

🎨 The Digital Muse: Overcomes creative blocks with Logic Pro production tips.

Dynamic Visualizers: Real-time CSS animations representing audio waveforms.

Strategic Roadmap: A step-by-step interactive timeline from credentialing to expansion.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Framework: React (v18+)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Glassmorphism & Neon Aesthetics)
